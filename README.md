# 🔐 Security Alert System Based on Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project presents a smart **Security Alert System** that uses **Facial Emotion Recognition** powered by **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect and respond to potential threats in real-time. The system monitors faces captured through a camera feed, classifies the emotional state, and triggers alerts if suspicious emotions (e.g., anger, fear, etc.) are detected.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Real-time facial emotion recognition using CNN
- 📸 Live video stream processing (webcam or CCTV integration)
- 🚨 Automatic alert triggering for potentially dangerous emotional states
- 📊 Visual representation of emotion statistics (optional)
- 🧠 Custom-trained CNN model for high accuracy

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy / Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **VS Code** for development

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The system captures a face using a video feed.
2. A CNN model processes the image and classifies the facial emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, fearful, neutral).
3. If the emotion falls into a predefined "alert" category (e.g., anger, fear):
   - An alert (sound, message, or other mechanism) is triggered.
   - (Optional) The frame can be saved or logged for review.
